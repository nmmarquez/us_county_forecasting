# SBH and CBH in small area estimation  

# overview  
- Use a set of SBH and CBH from DHS to estimate mortality  
- treat these estimate at multiple levels as truth  
- simulate data from these child mortality rates  
- vary sample size and time window to see how mean relative error changes  

# Method testing  
- estimate annual, 5 year, 10 year and 20 year mort  
- use disctete non overlapping time points and moving windows  
- use CBH and SBH methodologies  
- very sample size from 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000  
- also tested stratification  
- evaluation was done using error, relative error, absolute error, and absolute relative error  

# Results  
- Results are relatively unbiased and consistant at samples of 500  
- Multiple sets of surveys help alleviate bias issues
