# A comparison of conditional autoregressive models used in Bayesian disease mapping

## Intro 

- Contiguous spatial phenomenon exhibit correlation thats tough to deal with  
- This paper looks at using hierarchical models to model disease mapping  

## Disease Mapping  
- Disease mapping is areal and uses expected values and incidence to calc SIR  
- Small expected values or rare occurences make SIR falsely inflated  
  - In order to combat this spatial models are used  
  - neighboring areas give stregnth to estimates  
- Models generally follow the following formula  
$$
Y_k | E_k, R_k \sim Poisson(E_kR_k)
$$
$$
ln(R) = \beta X + \phi
$$  
- phi accounts for spatial correlation and overdispersion not captured in covs  

## Conditional autoregressive(CAR) models  
- CAR covariance structures are used to model spatial effects  
  - The probability of a point is conditional on its neighbors  
- $W$ is the adjacency matrix in all cases here  

### intrisic model iCAR  
$$  
\phi_k | \phi_{-k}, W, \tau^2 \sim \mathcal{N} \Big{(}\frac{1}{n_k} \sum_{j \sim k} \phi_j, \frac{\tau^2}{n_k} \Big{)}  
$$  

- mean is a function of value of neighbors and variance decreases with number of neighbors  
- model only estimates well things with strong spatial correlation  
- only has a single param $\tau$ which makes it a bit restrictive  
- structure is imprope because adding a constant to each $\phi$ doesnt change distrobution  
  - adding a sum to zero constraint remidies this  

### Convolution model  
$$
\phi_k = \theta_k + \psi_k
$$

- this model has each point have two seperate random effects  
- $\theta$ is a simple normal distribution while $\psi$ follows an iCAR  
- because we only observe the combined effect $\phi$, reliable estimates for components are not available  

### Cressie model  
$$
\phi_k | \phi_{-k}, W, \tau^2, \rho, \mu \sim \mathcal{N} \Big{(} \rho \times \frac{1}{n_k} \sum_{j \sim k} \phi_j + (1 - \rho)\mu, \frac{\tau^2}{n_k} \Big{)}
$$

- spatial effect is now weigthed by $\rho$
- because $\mu$ is present no intercept is required  
- covar matrixx is $\tau^2 Q_C^{-1}$  
  - $Q_C$ is like $Q$ but has the number of neigbors on the diagnol  
- This model is a little wack cause when $\rho$ is zero whats up with that variance  

### leroux model(lCAR)  
$$
\phi | W, \tau^2, \rho, \mu \sim \mathcal{N} \Big{(} \mu, \tau^2 [\rho W^* + (1-\rho) I_n]^{-1} \Big{)}
$$

- $W*$ is $-1$ where adjacent and number of neighbors on the diagnol  
- now $\phi$ is weighted by two matrices $W^*$ and $I$ (spatial & independent repsectively)  
- the model is proper as long as $\rho$ is between 0 and 1 where 1 is iCAR  
- the above form shows the MVN distribution see the paper for the univariate  

## Hyperpriors  

### $\rho$ correlation paramter

- discerte uniform prior is used to accelerate MCMC convergence  
- values from [0,1) with intervals of .05 or .03 are cool  

### Other params  

- all var params are assinged uniform priors (0,M) on SD scale  

### inference  
- MCMC is used for inference using a gibbs metropolis combo  
- All $\beta$ are updated using Metropolis steps using RW proposal distribution  
- Random effects are updated using block Metropolis updates  
- variance paramters are Gibbs sampled from full conditional inverse-gamma dist  
- $\phi$ is so obvious to update because its discrete they dont even say  

## Simulation  
- authors simulate 3 models of random effects  
  1. all independent  
  2. all driven from a spatial matern covariance  
  3. mix of 1 and 2  
- $\beta$ is evaluated by bias and rmse  
- $R_k$ is evaluated the same  
- residual spat cor is evaluated by Morans I test  

### results  
- lCAR crushes it  
- doesnt leave behind spatial AC after its done in the presence of strong spatial AC  
- doesnt attribute Ac where it doesnt exist, which woulb mess up $\beta$ and $R_k$  

## Application
